    "summary": "I have 20 years of experience in programming, security, operations and release engineering.  As an early cloud adopter, I’ve learned, the amount of services I manage increases to infinite possibilities.  Using containers, I’ve changed my mental model of what a task is.  I strive to make all scripts, jobs and apps run out of a container to achieve my goal of sleeping all night. Since all tasks should now be run from a container most of my time is now spent creating configurations to building C.I.C.D. piplines or auditing security and training other engineers best practices.",
